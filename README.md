## Vindo
A project I worked on Fall 2023 to get myself acquainted with the integration of Artificial Intelligence. At the time I was shopping around for new cars and wanted to know what packages they came equipped with. In my search I found that MOPAR Vehicle's Window Stickers
can be found online with a static URL. With some clever coding I managed to create a basic webpage that will take a VIN, fetch the PDF associated with it, pass it to ChatGPT, and finally spit it back out sorted and pretty.
